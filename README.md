# liledix4 Micro

Collection of tiny programs for various needs.

> **Discontinued!**

> Mini-apps work better as standalone repositories. Also, mini-apps like 2Fountain are too big to share a common repository with other things.
>
> **Plans for the future:**
>
> - ["9"](https://github.com/liledix4/9) was planned to be a web-based mockup of operating system, meaning that it's supposed to have mini-apps by nature, and in a windowed form compared to taking up nearly an entire browser window.
> - If user desires, mini-apps may still be used separately, as standalone web pages (and those would be more accessible and easier to maintain).
